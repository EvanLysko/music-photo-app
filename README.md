This is a small app that uses Spotify's API to retrieve song data based off of the users search.

The card with the song information links to the album, song, artist, etc on spotify and plays a 30 second sample on loop automatically with the ability to pause or play the sample as well.

The app uses Googles custom search API to retrieve images based off of the users search and displays them in a simple dynamic grid below.

It has dynamic styling and some simple but clean reactive design.

It is hosted on vercel because github pages was emotionally abusing me.
